description: Implement the transport-independent multiplayer protocol, lobby, authority, snapshots, and network adapters.

# claude-of-tanks / src/net

## Purpose

Provide one authoritative match path for campaign, LAN, private, and ranked
play without importing Three.js rendering or DOM state.

## Mental model & key files

- `protocol.ts` owns the strict wire vocabulary, envelopes, sequence arithmetic,
  and untrusted input validation.
- `lobby.ts` owns the strict canonical room model: teams, capacity, readiness,
  permissions, host migration, round state, and start policy.
- `lobbyRuntime.ts` owns typed lobby transport sequencing, payload admission,
  broadcast, and the lossless lobby-to-match channel handoff.
- `playerNames.ts`, `roomInvite.ts`, and `signalEndpoint.ts` own strict commander
  identity, share-link parsing, and deployment-aware signaling URL policy.
- `signalingClient.ts` owns strict request correlation, durable event polling,
  reconnect backoff, room-seat resume, and RTC-session epoch rotation.
- `matchRuntime.ts` owns fixed ticks, input ordering, snapshots, and client time.
- `inputCadence.ts` bounds replaceable input uploads independently from display
  refresh while preserving immediate control edges.
- `browserInputRuntime.ts` composes finite-point aim, action edges, and cadence
  behind explicit multiplayer intent; solo boot must not import it.
- `snapshot.ts` owns quantization, visibility filtering, and interpolation.
- `snapshotWireCodec.ts` owns strict compact binary snapshot rows; protocol v2 uses
  explicit snapshot acknowledgements, per-peer deltas, and periodic keyframes.
- `loopbackTransport.ts`, `channelTransport.ts`, and `webrtcPeer.ts` implement
  the same bounded transport contract.
- `localSession.ts` proves solo play traverses the real host/client path.
- `localTankPrediction.ts` owns typed local input replay and presentation-only
  correction; it never owns combat or match results.
- `networkFramePump.ts` owns browser host/client frame order, snapshot/event
  application, input cadence, snapshot barriers, and network diagnostics.
- `networkBattleBarrier.ts` owns first-authority and peer-ready predicates plus
  the identity-bound idempotent READY retry lease.
- `networkRoomCoordinator.ts` owns browser room subscriptions, garage/menu/chat
  presentation, selection commands, readiness, and rematch admission.
- `networkLobbyPreloader.ts` coalesces joined-room transfers, retries failed
  optional chunks, and warms only new roster builders or changed fixed maps.
- `networkBattleLaunchRuntime.ts` owns private/LAN, retained-room rematch, and
  ranked launch policy, including cold-loader presentation and terminal cleanup.
- `networkBattlePresentationRuntime.ts` owns the shared cold-client path from
  opaque loader through parallel module/world/transport acquisition, hidden
  roster preparation, initial authority, warmup, all-peer readiness, atomic
  activation, black-frame validation, and reveal.
- `networkBattlePresentationAccess.ts` keeps that deep multiplayer-only owner
  out of Garage/solo boot and retries failed intent transfers.
- `networkBattleActivationRuntime.ts` owns the atomic post-readiness transfer
  into live player or spectator presentation: world/HUD/FX/result reset, phase
  publication, camera ownership, and Garage shutdown.
- `connectionRecovery.ts` owns reconnect status and the single bounded failure
  edge; transport replacement remains below it.
- `rankedServiceClient.ts` owns service-scoped ladder identity and queue polling;
  `dedicatedClient.ts` owns authenticated WebSocket handoff and reconnect.
- `privateRoomSession.ts` owns typed lobby WebRTC composition and
  `rtcIceLease.ts` owns expiring TURN generations;
  `privateMatchHandoff.ts` is the strict lobby-to-match boundary: it
  deterministically fills open team slots with bots
  and releases those same channels to match authority.
- `browserBattleBridge.ts` is presentation-only and must stay lazy from main.

## Patterns and invariants

- Player/entity identity is independent from `specId`.
- Authority accepts controls only; it computes every gameplay result.
- Spotting filters data before serialization.
- Queues, extrapolation, catch-up, sequences, and payload sizes are bounded.
- WebRTC control/events stay reliable and ordered; replaceable snapshots and
  live input use the unordered zero-retransmit state lane. Fire/consumable
  edges repeat until acknowledged and authority deduplicates them. WebSocket
  snapshots and input coalesce under backpressure so stale state cannot
  consume control headroom.
- Initial RTC recovery replays pending SDP before creating a new ICE
  generation. Duplicate descriptions must be idempotent; never overlap offers
  merely because a fresh browser is slow.
- Local prediction replays the exact shared movement path. Reconciliation error
  is presentation-only: horizontal hull motion, terrain support/tilt, and live
  turret aim use separate bounded decay channels. Contacts may extend smoothing
  but must never change authority, collision, or ballistic state.
- Modules remain Node-runnable with no DOM/WebGL dependency.
- Network activation must remain one operation after the peer-ready barrier;
  do not publish battle phase or camera state piecemeal from `main.ts`.
- A bridge must remain private until its exact roster and viewer-bearing first
  snapshot are ready. Keep that order in `networkBattlePresentationRuntime.ts`;
  failed unpublished bridges are disposed before the launcher handles cleanup.
- Tests exercise the public host/client interface, not private internals.

## Verification

Run `node src/net/browserInputRuntime.selftest.mjs`, `node src/net/net.selftest.mjs`,
`node src/net/privateMatchHandoff.selftest.mjs`, then `npm test` and
`npm run build`. Network adapters additionally require browser-pair proof.
