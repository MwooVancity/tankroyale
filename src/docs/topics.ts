The simulation runs at a fixed 60 Hz, playable tanks use first-party procedural runtime geometry, and presentation pages stay isolated from the heavy game boot graph.', 'Those constraints shaped the architecture: deterministic rules can run in Node, the renderer adapts independently, and every public claim can point to code, a test, a capture, or a measured receipt.'],

Three.js turns the latest state into cameras, rigs, lighting, effects, audio, and UI without becoming the authority for a hit.', 'That boundary made local battles, browser-hosted rooms, and dedicated matches share the same combat rules. It also lets lower-end visual settings reduce cost without changing gameplay.'],

Broad or risky work moved into isolated Git worktrees; each lane named the files it owned, preserved unrelated changes, and exchanged exact commit hashes and evidence before integration.', 'The working rule was simple: main stays current, unfinished experiments stay isolated, and a branch is not proof. Only the integrated bytes count. Human direction set the target and acceptance bar; agents implemented, measured, reviewed, and documented against it.'],

The smallest plausible fix is tested with focused self-tests, browser interaction, console inspection, screenshots, and performance probes. A result must survive a second run or a deliberately hostile case before it is accepted.', 'Visual work is judged from current pixels, not only numeric checks. Performance work records cold and warm conditions, device constraints, long tasks, frame gaps, GPU resources, and transition timings instead of reporting a single FPS number.'],

Architecture decisions, performance receipts, geometry ledgers, generated diagrams, and review images keep conclusions out of chat-only memory.', 'When a manual process repeats, it becomes a script or a gate. That is why model screenshots, combat anatomy, vehicle icons, route probes, public metadata, and release checks are reproducible from the repository.'],
