## Purpose
<!-- agent-docs:fill:purpose -->
Own game-level orchestration between pure simulation, presentation, input, bots,
and persisted player choices.

## Mental model & key files
<!-- agent-docs:fill:model -->
`stateCore.ts` owns the dependency-free typed session shell and event bus;
`rosterState.ts` owns typed roster entities, battle-visual construction policy,
and deterministic participant/camouflage planning; `rosterPresentation.ts`
owns consistent lobby and pre-battle display rows without importing rendering
or authority code; `soloBattleAccess.ts` owns
retryable lazy acquisition while `soloBattleRuntime.ts` is the typed import
boundary for legacy solo authority in `state.ts`, which owns battle setup and
the fixed battle step; `battleEntryAcquisition.ts` owns covered solo/network
dependency order and timing; `battleWarmRuntime.ts` owns battle-only terrain,
wreck, Studio/shared FX, and covered deployment-program residency behind a
retryable typed access facade; `ai.ts`
owns bot decisions and is injected into the headless multiplayer authority;
`input.ts` normalizes devices; `profile.ts` persists real local match history;
`playerBattleActions.ts` owns ammunition, consumable, special-action, and
local-versus-network command policy without importing the combat runtime;
`equipment.ts` owns the strict catalog, persistence, legal-loadout, multiplier,
combat-attachment, bot-default, and Garage-stat contract shared by both
authorities;
`playerFrameInput.ts` owns allocation-free per-frame movement, fire, mouse,
touch, cursor fallback, zoom, free-look, and sniper-mode sampling;
`pointerLockFeedbackRuntime.ts` owns pointer-lock denial/restoration listeners,
the delayed cursor-aim notice, canvas recapture, and battle-start touch refresh;
`mobileAutoAimRuntime.ts` owns touch target acquisition, loss, UI state and the
allocation-free center-mass sample consumed by the camera input;
`sniperFillRuntime.ts` owns the retained shadow-free close-cover scope light;
`combatFeedbackRuntime.ts` owns discrete ERA, hit-confirm, camera-recoil,
prop-destruction, and Garage-residency reactions on the shared event bus;
`armorAimOverlay.ts` owns the typed, bounded scoped plate-penetration overlay;
`battleFrameRuntime.ts` owns pause edges, retained input sampling, network
cadence, pre-battle hold, fixed-step debt, result progression, and rendered
pose interpolation;
`battlePresentationRuntime.ts` owns solo/network pose selection, spotting
residency, running-gear detail cadence, vehicle FX, and light prop contact;
`battleHudFrameRuntime.ts` owns the retained HUD frame, spectator perspective,
spotting disclosure, aim publication, scoped armor targeting, and damage-panel
transaction;
`battleResultPresentationRuntime.ts` owns live player-death holds, result
replay handoff, final verdict presentation, and round/exit reset state;
`killcamAccess.ts` owns retryable replay acquisition and its stable inactive
facade; `killcam.js` owns replay presentation, while `studio.js` renders the
Scene Studio and `studioTimeline.ts` owns its strict JSON-safe storyboard and
allocation-free camera/actor sampling contract.
`garagePedestalRuntime.ts` owns hero construction, shader submission, warm LRU
residency, switch convergence, and battle visual handoff; it composes
`garagePedestalPreloader.ts` for exact card-intent and quiet neighbor warming.
`garageShowroomRuntime.ts` owns the Garage camera phase latch, pointer capture,
drag/wheel bindings, and disposal while the engine orbit remains the only pose
solver.
`garageReturnRuntime.ts` owns battle/Studio return teardown, retained-room
policy, world/hero handoff, coalesced leave transitions, and Battle Again
sequencing.
`garagePhasePresentationRuntime.ts` owns the authored Garage key lights,
neutral showroom sun, mutually exclusive scene membership, renewable dressing
GPU residency, world-root swaps, and terrain-relative stage placement. Camera
framing and pedestal pose math remain with their existing owners.
`garageDressingOptimization.ts` finalizes the fully streamed static workshop,
bakes descendant transforms, instances exact repeats, merges only compatible
semantic-free opaque surfaces, and removes only sub-resolution fitting shadows
while preserving authored vehicle exhibits, shadow proxies, and all color
geometry.
`battleIntentRuntime.ts` owns the explicit Battle hover/focus lifecycle:
concrete Random-map reservation, exact-roster texture coalescing, stale intent
cancellation, and the camouflage-safe handoff into covered loading. Passive
garage dwell never constructs a battlefield. `battleEntryLifecycle.ts` owns
entry exclusivity across every mode and the covered default-frame reveal gate.
`playSurfaceRuntime.ts` owns mode-specific menu acquisition, preload policy,
active-room reopening, solo bypass, and battle dismissal. Later-declared lazy
ports must stay behind closures so pristine boot never reads a temporal-dead-
zone binding while the composition root is still evaluating.
`soloBattleDeploymentRuntime.ts` owns the ordered solo deployment warm from
final camouflage through exact roster, terrain, FX, shader, CSM, post, and
reveal preparation; callers receive only generation and reveal receipts.
`soloBattleLoadingRuntime.ts` owns the complete covered solo entry around that
warm: exact world/roster acquisition, progress, texture upload, visual staging,
minimum loader dwell, reveal fallback, countdown calculation, and diagnostics.
`soloBattleStartRuntime.ts` owns the synchronous post-acquisition transaction
that resets round-scoped presentation, activates the world and roster, and
publishes the solo battle phase; `soloBattleStartAccess.ts` keeps it out of
Garage/multiplayer boot until covered solo intent.
The corresponding multiplayer lifecycle lives in
`src/net/networkBattlePresentationRuntime.ts`; `main.ts` supplies renderer and
world adapters but must not reimplement its preparation/readiness/reveal order.
Keep it behind `src/net/networkBattlePresentationAccess.ts` so Garage and solo
boot do not evaluate or allocate multiplayer-only presentation policy.

## Patterns to follow / invariants
<!-- agent-docs:fill:patterns -->
Keep authoritative rules deterministic and Node-runnable. Inject world, bus,
RNG, and presentation dependencies. Keep garage-safe session data in
`stateCore.ts`, visual/roster policy in `rosterState.ts`, and combat integration
in `state.ts`. Keep roster naming, filtering, and local-player ordering in
`rosterPresentation.ts`. Garage boot must not statically import `state.ts`; acquire it
through `soloBattleAccess.ts` on Battle or capture intent. Multiplayer work
must move visual creation out of authority rather than importing more UI into
`state.ts`.

## Common tasks → first action
<!-- agent-docs:fill:tasks -->
Trace callers in `src/main.ts`, run the nearest selftest, and preserve existing
event payloads. Keep garage/Studio-safe state in `stateCore.ts`; do not add
simulation or rendering imports there. Keep deterministic roster planning
independent from combat setup so battle intent can preload exact families.
Route Battle preload changes through `battleIntentRuntime.ts`; do not restore
independent map plans, texture generations, or garage timers in `main.ts`.
Route mode-picker and retained-room changes through `playSurfaceRuntime.ts`;
keep menu construction retryable and keep solo entry independent of the menu.
Acquire killcam implementation through `killcamAccess.ts`; do not restore its
promise state in the composition root. Route player shell, consumable, and
special-action policy through `playerBattleActions.ts`; inject combat and
network ports instead of importing either implementation. Route rendered
device polling through `playerFrameInput.ts`; keep the render loop ignorant of
bindings and device modes. Route rendered tank updates through
`battlePresentationRuntime.ts`; never apply the solo interpolation buffer to
already-smoothed network poses. Bot changes require both focused AI tests and
battle probes.
Route live HUD assembly through `battleHudFrameRuntime.ts`; do not rebuild
spectator focus, spotting, aim, armor-target filtering, or damage presentation
inside `main.ts`.
Route rendered gameplay advancement through `battleFrameRuntime.ts`; do not
retain pause transitions, fixed-step debt, countdown release, or parallel
solo/network authority policy in `main.ts`.
Route every battle/Studio return through `garageReturnRuntime.ts`; do not
recreate replay/tank/network/world teardown order or a leave-transition latch
in `main.ts`.
Route covered solo warm changes through `soloBattleDeploymentRuntime.ts`; do
not put shader, effect, shadow, or reveal ordering back into `main.ts`.
Route covered solo entry changes through `soloBattleLoadingRuntime.ts`; do not
recreate its acquisition barrier, progress policy, or reveal handoff in the
composition root.
Route post-acquisition solo round reset and phase activation through
`soloBattleStartRuntime.ts`; preload its access owner before the synchronous
handoff and do not rebuild that transaction in `main.ts`.
Route cold network entry changes through `networkBattlePresentationRuntime.ts`;
keep partial bridges private until roster preparation and initial authority
succeed.
Route result, death-beat, and replay-handoff changes through
`battleResultPresentationRuntime.ts`; keep those latches out of `tick()`.
Workshop changes must preserve the typed optimization receipt and pass the
phase resource gate; do not re-enable shadows on every tiny static fitting.

## Gotchas
<!-- agent-docs:fill:gotchas -->
`state.ts` still mixes solo battle orchestration with some visual lifecycle
calls; deepen that seam incrementally through `rosterState.ts` without pulling
the solo graph back into garage boot. Entity IDs historically equal spec IDs
and must not remain so in multiplayer.
