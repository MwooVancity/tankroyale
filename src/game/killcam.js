/**
 * killcam.js — War Thunder-class kill camera (integration-owned module).
 *
 * CAPTURE: state.ts calls `game.killcam.recordSimStep(game)` every fixed step
 * (shell trajectory points) and `game.killcam.onShellHit(ev, target)` for every
 * resolved HitEvent (clearly-marked KILL-CAM sections there). Everything shown
 * during a replay comes from those snapshots — shooter/target poses, the full
 * trajectory, and the sim-resolved HitEvent (zone, nominal/effective armor,
 * rolls, modules/crew, ammo-rack flag). Nothing is recomputed and nothing
 * reads live AI state during playback.
 *
 * PLAYBACK (main.ts drives it at battle end):
 *  -1. WRECK (killcam r2, death view only, freshKill flag): the player died
 *      THIS moment and the battle is decided — before any replay chrome
 *      moves the camera away, a live-action hold (~2.2 s) keeps the frame on
 *      the player's own tank while the REAL destruction plays out at sim
 *      rate: fx fireball/debris/smoke stay visible and the killcam itself
 *      advances the victim's turret-pop/burn timelines (the sim/visual sync
 *      loop is frozen during replays). Mid-battle deaths get the same beat
 *      OUTSIDE the killcam (main.ts death beat — full-volume audio), so this
 *      phase self-gates on the freshness flag.
 *   0. APPROACH — eased establishing arc
 *      orbit from the player's live death view to the killer's position,
 *      landing exactly on the restored attacker's firing pose (no cuts). A
 *      shock flash + sliding letterbox + staggered chrome open the replay;
 *      a screen-space grade (desaturate + vignette) ramps over the death
 *      view. Exit is a letterbox close + fade-through-black into whatever
 *      follows (ally spectate / end screen), with scene teardown at black.
 *   1. FLIGHT — tracer chase along the captured trajectory from the
 *      killer's muzzle to the victim, at normal replay speed ramping to
 *      ~0.25x slow-mo through the final meters into the penetration.
 *   1b. IMPACT (killcam r2, owner: "show the actual animations of popping
 *      turrets and exploding, especially during kill cam"): the moment the
 *      tracer reaches the plate, the kill plays out LIVE before any
 *      analysis — detonation flash, fx fireball/debris/smoke re-fired on
 *      the restaged victim, the turret-pop arc tumbling at full rate with a
 *      brief ~0.55x dilation through the launch (fx clock scaled via
 *      main.ts), the camera pushed out and eased back onto the x-ray
 *      vantage. Ammo-rack kills toss the turret (pop 1.0), plain kills jolt
 *      it (pop 0.22) — same setDestroyed grammar as live play, GLB and
 *      procedural alike. Emits 'killcam:impact' {cause,pos,timeScale} on the
 *      bus as the additive audio seam for the replayed cinematic blast.
 *   2. X-RAY  — the victim rendered ghost-translucent (view-dependent fresnel
 *      skin, alpha-over blending that saturates instead of stacking to white,
 *      no depth writes so GTAO never shades a phantom hull), recognizable
 *      internal proxies drawn OVER the skin (ammo cassettes, engine block,
 *      fuel drums, crew capsules) tinted WHITE/yellow/red by post-hit state
 *      (WT convention — identity lives in shapes + chips, never the tint),
 *      the shell path drawn through the hull all the way to the deepest
 *      damaged component with a spall cone at the penetration point plus
 *      causal fragment streaks to every damaged module/crew slot, every
 *      module / crew box outlined, hit ones highlighted + DOM-labeled with
 *      leader lines and overlap deconfliction, and an annotation block
 *      (shell, distance, angle, nominal→effective armor, pen roll, damage).
 *      Holds XRAY_HOLD_S, any key/click skips.
 *   3. FINALE (killcam r3, OWN DEATHS ONLY — owner: "shows the tank as it was
 *      before it blew up with the turret still attached, then the skeleton
 *      with shell going through, and then us blowing up and turret coming off
 *      again"): when the player is the victim the IMPACT beat above is
 *      RE-ORDERED to play AFTER the x-ray. The analysis layer is torn down
 *      first (endXrayDressing — ghost skin, veil, internals, chips, light dim
 *      and vegetation hide all released, so nothing phantom survives over the
 *      fireball), then the exact same impact beat runs and exits to the
 *      results. Phase order per replay direction:
 *        own death, shell kill : [wreck] approach [flight] xray impact exit
 *        own death, burn-out   : [wreck] xray exit           (no rack pop —
 *                                the cook-off already played live)
 *        player kill / staged  : approach flight impact xray exit  (r2 order)
 *
 * The camera is driven exclusively through rig.setExternalPose (the rig's
 * external-pose API) — the rig is used, never modified.
