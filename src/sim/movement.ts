/**
 * movement.ts — pure-logic tank movement, attitude, turret/gun kinematics and
 * dispersion bloom. Implements docs/research/movement-physics.md §2–§8 and §10
 * under the interface locked in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §3.4.
 *
 * Conventions (ARCHITECTURE §1.1): meters / seconds / radians, +Y up,
 * forwardAxis(yaw) = [sin(yaw), 0, cos(yaw)], rightAxis(yaw) = [cos(yaw), 0, -sin(yaw)],
 * yaw = 0 faces +Z, positive pitch = nose up.
 * ROLL SIGN (locked by the renderer): every consumer composes the pose as
 * rotation.set(-visualPitch, yaw, visualRoll, 'YXZ') (tankFactory syncFromState,
 * armor buildFrames, damage.ts, killcam) — under that composition POSITIVE roll
 * lifts the RIGHT side (worldY of a hull-local point = pos.y
 * + x·sin(roll)·cos(pitch) + z·sin(pitch)). The r5 terrain-contact gate traced
 * one track buried ~1 m while the other floated at rest to the old fit using
 * the opposite ("right side down") sign: the hull leaned INTO every side slope.
 *
 * No rendering, no DOM, no top-level side effects — runs under plain node.

    //     noise, not an aiming problem the player can fix. Parked or creeping
    //     hull-down lays (the deliberate case) keep the label.
    //  2. DWELL: any labeled state needs GUN_LIMIT_LABEL_DWELL_S of
