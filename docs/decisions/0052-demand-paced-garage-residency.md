# ADR 0052: Static Garage work and residency are bounded

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-08-27

## Context

Frame rate alone hid two expensive behaviors. A settled Garage executed the
complete render pipeline at display cadence, including audio, lighting,
postprocessing and scene traversal. Passive dwell could also construct a full
battlefield, while desktop caches allowed ten pedestal tanks, unlimited worlds
and four detached rematch visuals to remain resident.

The fixed showroom framing made one cost especially unnecessary: its periodic
measurement traversed every selected-tank mesh, then discarded the result in
favor of a canonical box.

## Decision

`src/engine/garageFramePacer.ts` is the typed owner of settled Garage cadence.
Visible camera motion and user activity run at display cadence; a static scene
uses a 2 Hz watchdog paint so un-signaled asynchronous completion still
appears within 500 ms. The showroom framing solve runs only on those paints or
while it is visibly moving. DOM and CSS transitions remain browser-composited.

Persistent room/session pumping is deliberately outside this WebGL gate. A
static Garage may paint at 2 Hz without reducing signaling recovery, host
snapshot, or reconnect cadence.

The production phase-resource gate also enforces broad release ceilings for
task CPU, forced-GC JavaScript heap, renderer programs, geometries, textures,
complete-frame draw calls, and complete-frame primitive counts in settled
Garage, active battle, and returned Garage. The probe disables Three's
per-pass diagnostics reset only while measuring, so the receipt includes the
scene, shadow maps, and postprocessing rather than the final fullscreen
triangle alone. These are regression ceilings above the healthy baseline, not
quality targets; they prevent a high FPS reading from hiding excessive work.

Fixed showroom framing never measures the vehicle subtree and writes a camera
pose only when framing or motion changed. Passive dwell no longer constructs a
world. Desktop residency is bounded at four pedestal visuals, two world scenes,
and two detached battle visuals; mobile retains its stricter existing limits.

## Consequences

- Static-screen CPU scales with visible work rather than monitor refresh rate.
- First Garage dwell retains no battlefield heap, geometry, textures or shader
  programs.
- Drag, zoom, spring motion, vehicle switching and CSS presentation remain
  full-rate and visually unchanged.
- Battle and rematch intent still reuse explicitly requested worlds and a small
  visual pool, without unbounded browsing history.
