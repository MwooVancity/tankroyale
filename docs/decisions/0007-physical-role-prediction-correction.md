# 0007 — Local correction is physical-role presentation state

## Context

The locally controlled tank predicts the same fixed-step movement as authority.
Snapshot reconciliation can still expose small disagreements from terrain
support, dynamic contact, and network timing. Releasing every positional and
angular error through one fast envelope makes a heavy tracked hull appear to
jump vertically or oscillate near another tank. Slowing every channel together
would make the gun feel detached from the player's aim.

## Decision

- Keep authority acceptance, input replay, collision, ballistics, and hard-snap
  policy unchanged.
- Treat reconciliation error as presentation-only state.
- Group horizontal translation and yaw, support height/pitch/roll, and
  turret/gun aim into independently bounded decay channels.
- Use 110 ms horizontal, 160 ms support, and 75 ms aim envelopes normally.
- After terrain or dynamic contact, use 180 ms horizontal and 240 ms support
  envelopes for 300 ms. Aim remains live on its 75 ms envelope.
- Bound one displayed frame to 20 cm of horizontal correction and 10 cm of
  support-height correction. A slow render frame may extend convergence, but
  cannot turn accumulated network error into one visible hull jump.
- Keep the parked hull hold for sub-contact-patch quantization noise; never
  apply that hold to turret or gun articulation.
- Measure the largest correction release and vertical release in browser tests.

## Consequences

The rendered tank reads as a supported heavy body without weakening server
authority or delaying aim. Network or contact disagreement remains visible for
the minimum additional frames needed to respect the release bound instead of
becoming one sharp jump. Terminal destruction and errors above seven metres
retain the existing immediate synchronization path.

## Verification

- `predictionCorrection.selftest.mjs` proves grouped decay and resting-aim
  independence.
- `localTankPrediction.selftest.mjs` proves a contact correction releases less
  than 3 cm total and 2 cm vertically in one 60 Hz frame.
- Rendered two-browser and full 7v7 gates reject hard snaps, dropped history,
  correction release above 0.25 m, or vertical release above 0.15 m.
